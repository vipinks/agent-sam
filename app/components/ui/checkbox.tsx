 * A checkbox, as shadcn builds one over Radix.
 *
 * Beside the switch rather than replaced by it, because the two are not the same statement: a switch is a
 * setting that is already in one of its two states and is being moved, and a checkbox is a choice being
 * made in a form that has not been written yet. The add-server dialog is the second kind, which is why the
 * one flag it offers is one of these and the row's toggle for the same flag is a switch.
