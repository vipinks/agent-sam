## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/guasam/electron-react-app

# Change directory
cd electron-react-app

# Install dependencies (use any package manager: npm, yarn, pnpm, bun)
npm install
```

<br />

## Development

```bash
npm run dev
```

This starts Electron with hot-reload. `main` is deliberately minimal — a themed window frame,
titlebar, menus, and the typed IPC layer — so you can start building your app on top of it
immediately.

### Removing the welcome screen

The window opens on a short tour of the stack. It is the one piece meant to be thrown away, and it
is built so that costs nothing: it lives entirely in `app/components/welcome`, nothing else imports
it, and it adds no IPC modules of its own.

```bash
rm -rf app/components/welcome
```

Then drop the `<Welcome />` line and its import from `app/app.tsx`. What's left is an empty window
with the shell still around it, ready for your app.

### Try the demo

Want to see everything the stack can do first? The **`demo`** branch is an interactive
playground of every IPC primitive (cross-window state, streaming, background tasks, middleware),
with the real source behind each demo:

```bash
git switch demo
npm install
npm run dev
```

Switch back to `main` (and re-run `npm install`) when you're ready to build.

## Conveyor — Inter-Process Communication

IPC is powered by [electron-conveyor](https://github.com/guasam/electron-conveyor).
One definition in main is the single source of truth for a feature; the renderer client is
**inferred** from it — no channel strings, no hand-written API classes, no query keys.

Five primitives:

| You want…                            | Use           | Renderer side                        |
| ------------------------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Read something from main             | `query()`     | `await it()`, or `.useQuery()`       |
| Tell main to do something            | `command()`   | `await it()`, or `.useMutation()`    |
| Chunks pushed as they're produced    | `stream()`    | `for await`, or `.useStream()`       |
| Main pushing to the renderer         | `event()`     | `.subscribe(cb)`, or `.useEvent(cb)` |
| State shared live across all windows | `defineStore` | `useConveyorStore(def)`              |

### Adding a feature (two edits)

**1. Define the module** in `conveyor/modules/`:

```ts
// conveyor/modules/notes.ts — runs in MAIN only
import { z } from 'zod'
import { defineModule, query, command } from '../init'

export const notesModule = defineModule({
  list: query(() => readNotes()),

  // input crosses the trust boundary → schema required, validated on every call
  save: command(z.object({ title: z.string(), body: z.string() }), ({ input }) => saveNote(input)),
})
```

**2. Register it** in `conveyor/router.ts`:

```ts
export const router = createRouter(
  {
    window: windowModule,
    web: webModule,
    notes: notesModule, // ← the key becomes the module id
  },
  { createContext, use: [devLogger] }
)
```

Done — the renderer client already knows it, fully typed:

```tsx
import { conveyor } from '@/conveyor/client'

function Notes() {
  const notes = conveyor.notes.list.useQuery() // key derived from the path — never hand-written
  const save = conveyor.notes.save.useMutation({
    onSuccess: () => conveyor.notes.list.invalidate(),
  })

  return <button onClick={() => save.mutate({ title: 'Hi', body: '...' })}>Save</button>
}
```

Outside React, every member is a plain typed call: `await conveyor.notes.list()`.

### Handler context

Every handler receives `ctx`: the calling `window` and `sender`, plus the app context defined in
`conveyor/init.ts` (this starter kit provides `appStartedAt`, the `windows` manager, and
`openWindow`). Middleware can guard and widen it:

```ts
const authed = command.use(requireUser) // a reusable guarded base
export const account = defineModule({
  delete: authed(({ ctx }) => deleteAccount(ctx.user.id)),
})
```

### Streams (LLM-style)

```ts
// main
respond: stream(z.string(), async function* ({ input, signal }) {
  for await (const token of llm.complete(input)) {
    if (signal.aborted) return
    yield token
  }
})

// renderer
for await (const token of conveyor.stream.respond(prompt)) append(token)
```

### Events (main → renderer push)

```ts
// main — typed emitters per window or fan-out via the window manager
const emit = createEmitter(windowModule, win)
win.on('focus', () => emit.onFocusChange(true))

// renderer
conveyor.window.onFocusChange.useEvent(setFocused)
```

### Cross-window stores

```ts
// conveyor/stores/shared.ts — pure, imported by BOTH processes
export const sharedStore = defineStore('shared', {
  state: { count: 0, notes: [] as string[] },
  schemas: { add: z.string() }, // payloads validated in main; types flow from the schema
  actions: {
    add: (s, note) => {
      s.notes.push(note)
    },
    increment: (s) => {
      s.count += 1
    },
  },
  persist: true, // survives restarts (JSON under userData)
})

// renderer — feels local, synced across every window
const count = useConveyorStore(sharedStore, (s) => s.count)
const { add, increment } = useConveyorActions(sharedStore)
```

### Errors

Failures re-throw in the renderer as `ConveyorError` with a stable `code` — including custom codes
thrown by your handlers (`throw new ConveyorError('LOCKED', '...')`). Branch on `err.code`, never
on message strings. See the `demo` branch's **Middleware** page for a working example.

<br />

## Custom Window Components

This starter kit includes a custom window implementation with:

- Custom titlebar with app icon
- Window control buttons (minimize, maximize, close)
- Menu system with keyboard shortcuts
- Dark/light mode toggle
- Cross-platform support for Windows and macOS

<br />

### Titlebar Menu Toggle

The titlebar menu can be toggled using:

- **Windows**: Press the `Alt` key
- **macOS**: Press the `Option (⌥)` key

When you press the toggle key:

- If the menu is hidden, it becomes visible
- If the menu is already visible, it gets hidden
- The menu only toggles if menu items are available

<br />

### Customizing Menu Items

To add, remove or modify menu items, update the following file:

- `app/shell/menu.ts`

<br />

## Key Directories Explained

#### `app/` - Renderer Process

- **React application** that runs in the browser window
- `app/shell/` — titlebar, menus, window frame, theme

#### `conveyor/` - The IPC Surface

- `conveyor/init.ts` — authoring primitives bound to the app's context
- `conveyor/modules/` — feature modules (**main-process only**; the renderer imports only `type AppRouter`)
- `conveyor/router.ts` — the single registration point (modules, stores, middleware, context)
- `conveyor/client.ts` — the typed renderer client with hooks

#### `lib/main/` - Main Process

- Window creation (`app.ts`, with the window manager), app lifecycle, `res://` protocol

#### `lib/preload/` - Preload Script

- Two lines: expose the conveyor bridge. It never changes as your API grows, and it is
  sandbox-compatible — the renderer runs with `sandbox: true`

<br />

## Path Aliases

```ts
import { Button } from '@/app/components/ui/button'
import { conveyor } from '@/conveyor/client'
```

- `@/app/` → `app/` (renderer)
- `@/lib/` → `lib/` (main + preload)
- `@/conveyor/` → `conveyor/` (the IPC surface)
- `@/resources/` → `resources/` (build resources)

<br />

## Development Workflow

1. **UI Development**: Work in `app/` with React components
2. **IPC**: Add a module in `conveyor/modules/`, register it in `conveyor/router.ts`
3. **Window Features**: Customize the shell in `app/shell/`
4. **Checks**: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, `npm run format`

<br />

## Building for Production

```bash
# For Windows
npm run build:win

# For macOS
npm run build:mac

# For Linux
npm run build:linux

# Unpacked for all platforms
npm run build:unpack
```

Distribution files will be located in the `dist` directory.

<br />

## Packaging

Sam AI ships as a personal-use desktop app. Builds are unsigned, and this section is the honest
version of what that means.

### Targets

Running a build script produces an installer plus a portable archive:

| Script                | Produces                                                            |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build:win`   | NSIS installer (`sam-ai-<version>-setup.exe`) and a portable `.zip` |
| `npm run build:mac`   | `.dmg` (arm64 + x64)                                                |
| `npm run build:linux` | `.AppImage`                                                         |

Output lands in `dist/`. `npm run build:unpack` produces an unpacked directory instead, which is what
the smoke test in this repository uses because it launches faster than an installer round-trip.

Each script runs `vite:build:app` first, so `out/` (what the main process loads) is always rebuilt
from the current sources before electron-builder packs it. `main` in `package.json` is
`./out/main/main.js`, and `resources/` is shipped beside `out/` inside the app — the main process
resolves its window icon at `../../resources/build/icon.png`, so both must stay in the packaged tree.

### Code signing: not configured

**Windows builds are unsigned.** On first run Windows SmartScreen will show "Windows protected your
PC" and the user has to choose _More info_ → _Run anyway_. A freshly downloaded file may also carry an
"isn't commonly downloaded" warning. This is expected behaviour for an unsigned binary, not a
malfunction, and it is acceptable for the current goal of distributing to people who already know what
the app is.

macOS builds are unsigned and un-notarized too: Gatekeeper will refuse a plain double-click, and the
workaround is right-click → Open, or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Sam AI.app"`.
Hardened runtime is deliberately off, because it only earns its keep alongside real signing — enabling
it now would add breakage without removing any warning.

The intended path when this stops being personal-use is **SignPath-style signing** — a managed
code-signing service (SignPath.io, or Azure Trusted Signing) that holds the certificate and signs
builds in CI rather than on a developer machine. The pieces that would need to change are confined to
CI and `electron-builder.yml`: add the signing identity and the platform `sign` configuration first,
then notarization for macOS, and only then enable `hardenedRuntime`. The app itself needs no change,
which is why signing is deferred rather than simulated now.

### User data and the directory name

Encrypted API keys, session transcripts and window state live under the OS's per-user application data
directory, in a directory named `era`:

- Windows: `%APPDATA%\era`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/era`
- Linux: `~/.config/era`

That name is **not** branding and must not be renamed. It is pinned in code
(`lib/main/identity.ts`, which runs before any persisted state is read). The reason is not
sentimentality about the folder name: Chromium keeps the key that protects `safeStorage` ciphertext in
`<userData>/Local State`, so pointing the app at a new userData directory makes saved API keys
permanently undecryptable, with the old file still on disk and unreadable. That failure was measured,
not assumed — see the commit that introduced this section, or run the probe:

```bash
bash tests/probes/run-law0-matrix.sh
```

One caveat that is untested: on macOS, `safeStorage`'s master key is additionally wrapped by a Keychain
item named after the app, so a rename _might_ break key decryption there even with the directory
pinned. The probe covers the `Local State` layer; the Keychain layer has not been exercised on a real
macOS build. Treat macOS key carry-over as unverified until someone runs the probe there.
